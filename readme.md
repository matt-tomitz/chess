##Run chess.py to begin

Notes:
-Still very much a WIP, some parts are implemented lazily or not at all
-Castling is only partially implemented so it may be buggy
-There is not yet any concept of check or checkmate
-Alternating turns is not enforced (for testing purposes), feel free to move the same piece 8 times in a row
**Territory map does not remove captured pieces
